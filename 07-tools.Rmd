# Data Programming {-}

## R

  * [R](https://www.r-project.org/)
      
      + To download R, choose a [CRAN mirror](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) closest to your geographic location.
      + In order to build R packages, you should also download the latest recommended version of [Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). Currently, the latest recommended version is `Rtoools35.exe`.
      + During installation, there should be an option to add Rtools to system path. You should check this option.
      <!-- + During the installation of Rtools, you may need to add in `"C:\Rtools\mingw_64\bin;"` to the path. -->
      + Afterwards, input the following code into R. If the output is TRUE, then Rtools was installed properly.
      
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
find_rtools()

```


      
  * [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
  
      + R Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. After downloading R Studio, you should be able to type the following command at the console to download some common R packages for data analysis and visualization.
      
```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("dplyr", "tidyr", "ggplot2", "esquisse", "stats", "xtable"))
```

## Cleaning and Reshaping Data

```{r, results='asis', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
library(reshape2)
library(tidyr)
library(xtable)
library(stringr)
library(knitr)
options(kableExtra.latex.load_packages = FALSE)
library(kableExtra)
library(pander)


#original data is organized by id/trial (two locations per entry)
game <- data.frame(id = c(rep("X",3), rep("Y",3), rep("Z",3)),
           trial = rep(c(1,2,3), 3),
           location_A = round(rnorm(9, mean = 0, sd = 1), 1),
           location_B = round(rnorm(9, mean = 0, sd = 1), 1))

# reshape data from wide to long (each entry is unique by id/trial/location)
game_long <- melt(game, id = c("id","trial"), value.name = "score")
game_long$variable <- str_sub(game_long$variable,-1,-1)
colnames(game_long)[3] <- "location"

# reshape data back to wide (same as original data)
game_wide <- dcast(game_long, id + trial ~ location, value.var = "score")
# reshape data into even wider form (one entry per id with 6 value columns: 2 locations X 3 trials)
game_wider <- dcast(game_long, id ~ location + trial, value.var = "score")

# using tidyr and dplyr to reshape data
game_long2 <- game %>% gather(label, score, location_A, location_B) %>%
    separate(label, c("label_p1","location"), sep = "_") %>%
    dplyr::select(-label_p1)

game_wide2 <- game_long2 %>% spread(location, value = score)

#unite() function creates the location X trial combinations first in long format # then apply the spread() function to reshape into wide format
#just like in game_wide, each entry in game_wide2 is unique by id
game_wider2 <- game_long2 %>% unite(location_trial, location, trial) %>%
    spread(location_trial, value = score)

#xtable method
#print(xtable(game, caption = "Wide Data Listed by Person/Trial (Scores by Location)"), type="html")

#kable method
#kable(game, caption = "Wide Data Listed by Person/Trial (Scores by Location)", booktabs = TRUE) %>%
#    kable_styling(latex_options = c("hold_position"))

#pander method (most flexible)
pandoc.table(game, caption = "(\\#tab:wide) Wide Data Listed by Person/Trial (Scores by Location)")
```

```{r, results='asis', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
pandoc.table(game_wider, caption = "(\\#tab:wider) Wider Data Listed by ID (Scores by Location/Trial)")
```

```{r, results='asis', warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
pandoc.table(game_long, caption = "(\\#tab:long) Long Data")
```

# Literate Programming {-}

## LaTeX

  * [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download)
      - First, download MiKTeX. Choose the version corresponding to your operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux). Skip this step if you decide to use ShareLaTeX, which is an online LaTeX editor and does not require your computer to have underlying LaTeX packages via MiKTeX.
      - Recommended, download the basic installer, which will download other uninstalled packages on the fly on an as-needed basis. If you want to download all packages, you can choose the Net Installer, but this may take up a lot of space.

# Version Control {-}

  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
  
## Github

3 Parts of Version Control

1. Working Directory: This is the folder where you store your files (e.g., `C:\Home\hw1`)
2. Staging Area: Every time you make changes to your files, you need to stage the files. This tells git that these files are ready 
3. Repository: Every working directory that uses git for version control will have a `.git` folder, which records info about each version of the working directory.

<!-- Terms: -->
<!--   * HEAD: where we are in the current commit -->
<!--   * master: -->
<!--   * origin: -->

Basic git commands:

```
git --version
```

  * Check version of git
  
```
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email "johndoe@example.com"
```

  * Configure git to recognize you
  
```
git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email
``` 

  * Confirm that user name/e-mail are configured
  
```
git init
touch readme.md
git add readme.md
git commit -m "added readme file"
``` 

  * Initialize new repository
      - If you are at the file path `C:\Home\hw1`, `git init` will initialize the repository in the `hw1` folder
      - An invisible `.git` folder will be created in the `hw1` folder to track files.
      - If you are at the file path `C:\Home` and have not created the `hw1` folder, then you can type `git init hw1`, which will create the `hw1` folder and initialize the repo.
 
      - The code above did the following:
        1. `git init`: initialize repository
        2. `touch readme.md`: added a blank readme Markdown file
        3. `git add readme.md`: staged readme.md (this tells git that you are ready to commit this file to the repo)
        4. `git commit -m "added readme file"`: committed changed to the repo (`-m` allows us to add a message)
        
```
git diff
```

  * Check differences between in the staging area and working directory.
  - Output: difference between each file that has changed since you last staged files (`git add`)
  - If you have staged all files, this command will output nothing, since nothing is different between your working directory and staging area.
  
  
```
git diff --staged
```
    
  * Check the differences between staging area and repository.
  

```
git log
```
  * See list of commits.
  

```
git reset file1.md
```

  * Suppose `file1.md` was staged, but I want to remove it from the staging area.
    - Now, `file1.md` will be untracked.
  

  
```
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git
git push -u origin master
```  

  * Create a new repository in Github. Link your local working directory with the Github repo with these commands. 
    - `git remote add`: sends commits to the location `origin`
    - We associated `origin` as a shortcut for the Github repo `https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>.git`.
    - `git push -u origin master`
        + Send `master` branch to remote repo called `origin`
        + Option `-u` allows us to use `git push` as a shortcut for `git push origin master` in the future
